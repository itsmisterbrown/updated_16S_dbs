# updated 16S databases for marker gene taxonomic assignment

All databases are formatted for compatibility with the [DADA2 workflow](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html)

Taxa added are documented in the same directory as the sequence files.

The image below was generated from datasets of stools from 149 South African infants (Fecal) and vaginal swabs from 564 adult African women (Vaginal)

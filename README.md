# updated 16S databases for marker gene taxonomic assignment

All databases are formatted for compatibility with the [DADA2 workflow](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html)

Taxa added are documented in the same directory as the sequence files.

The image below was generated from datasets of stools from 149 South African infants (Fecal; V6 region; HiSeq 2500) and vaginal swabs from 564 adult African women (Vaginal; V3-4 regions; MiSeq). 

As of Sept. 16 2020 (despite not being shown in the figure below), this repository also includes an updated version of [Silva 138](https://www.arb-silva.de/documentation/release-138/) as well!
